# COP 4331 Project
# Product Vision

The target audience of our product is for college students. Our product will allow students to manage their weekly time allocated to studying for the courses they are taking. It is for students who want to be able to organize and manage their time in an easy and effortless way. The product is called MyTime; a personal time management assistant.

During these trying times of pandemics and such, it has become increasingly difficult to manage workloads and balance your time easily between different classes or tasks. MyTime will allow students to have an easy to use app that will show them how much time they should be spending on each course on a weekly basis. The application will also include a timer that can be set by the user. After the timer is up, MyTime will remind the student to stop studying and take a small break (while also providing some small exercise). The timer will also deduct the time taken by the student from the available time the course has for that week.

Current products such as "Move" provide users with reminders to get up while working/sitting for long periods of time. The application "Move" also randomly gives the user an exercise to complete with every reminder. On the contrary, our product allows users to not only get reminders to get up and move around after being stationary for a while, it allows them to manage their weekly amount of time that they have to work on the different courses they may be taking.
