# COP 4331 Project
# Product Vision

The target audience of our product is for college students. Our product will allow students to manage their weekly time allocated to studying for the courses they are taking. It is for students who want to be able to organize and manage their time in an easy and effortless way. The product is called MyTime; a personal time management assistant.

During these trying times of pandemics and such, it has become increasingly difficult to manage workloads and balance your time easily between different classes or tasks. MyTime will allow students to have an easy to use app that will show them how much time they should be spending on each course on a weekly basis. The application will also include a timer that can be set by the user. After the timer is up, MyTime will remind the student to stop studying and take a small break (while also providing some small exercise). The timer will also deduct the time taken by the student from the available time the course has for that week.

Current products such as "Move" provide users with reminders to get up while working/sitting for long periods of time. The application "Move" also randomly gives the user an exercise to complete with every reminder. On the contrary, our product allows users to not only get reminders to get up and move around after being stationary for a while, it allows them to manage their weekly amount of time that they have to work on the different courses they may be taking.

## Task Allocation

_Hasan Assaidi_ - Revision of product vision statement and setup of trello board

_Yoseph Hassan_ - Created user stories and validations for the product backlog

_Jean Cestin_ -

_Christopher Delarosa_ - Worked on Burndown & Velocity charts

_Pedro Nemalceff_ -

During this sprint, I completely changed our product's vision statement. In addition I setup the trello board for the group to collaborate on. I also created the source code file of the product and included a few of the libraries requiredto develop an android app in java. (Hasan Assaidi)

While working through this sprint I mainly worked on finishing the prodcut backlog and coming up with user stories that would be consistent with what was proposed in the product vision. I also decribed the validation criteria for each of these user stories and their relative priority as well as the estimated difficulty. (Yoseph Hassan)

I managed both burndown and velocity charts over the course of this sprint. For the burndown chart, I based it off a percentage of effort that the group may be exherting over each sprint in the project's life cycle. Similarly, the velocity chart is spaced to account for the number of tasks we would like to achieve for the sprint vs the amount we would actually end up completing. (Christopher Delarosa)
