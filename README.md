# COP 4331 Project
# Product Vision

The target audience of the product is for business owners/organizations as well as the customers for those businesses (average consumers). Our product will allow business owners to register their business through a website. In turn, this will allow the users/consumers of the website to be able to select the desired company/business and book either a meeting or appointment with them based on the possible meeting times the company/business has provided. The product is called MyBooks; a booking assistant for all of your scheduling needs.

During these trying times of pandemics and such, more and more individuals are in need of scheduling vital appointments to conform with the incredibly restrictive etiquette associated with social distancing. In order to keep numbers low many companies have resorted to scheduling events such that they can accommodate a certain number of individuals. These services are typically inconsistent and provide a negative experience. One of our goals is to provide an easy to use platform which provides efficiency to save users both time and stress when booking appointments. Another approach which some companies take is that of scheduling meetings through automated phone calls. This process takes a significant amount of time to book a simple appointment and this process can be heavily improved as compared to the current standard.

Current products such as Google Calendar allow for users to record and save the times of their meetings and appointments. On the contrary, our product allows users to not only see all of their meetings in one area, it allows them to manage the meetings all in one place (as long as the organization is registered on the website). Another website, known as Booksy, allows for users to book appointments with different companies. However, our product will differ by not being solely centered around hair and beauty salons. Instead, MyBooks will allow any company to register and even allow those companies to manage their clients directly in the website. Clients using the website will have a single, easy-access website that will manage their appointments to several different companies depending on what they need. Business owners, on the other hand, will essentially have their scheduling done for them, as their clients will be able to see times when they are available.
