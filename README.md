# COP-4331 Project (MyTime)
# Product Vision

The target audience of our product is for college students. Our product will allow students to manage their weekly time allocated to studying for the courses they are taking. It is for students who want to be able to organize and manage their time in an easy and effortless way. The product is called MyTime; a personal time management assistant.

During these trying times of pandemics and such, it has become increasingly difficult to manage workloads and balance your time easily between different classes or tasks. MyTime will allow students to have an easy to use app that will show them how much time they should be spending on each course on a weekly basis. The application will also include a timer that can be set by the user. After the timer is up, MyTime will remind the student to stop studying and take a small break (while also providing some small exercise). The timer will also deduct the time taken by the student from the available time the course has for that week.

Current products such as "Move" provide users with reminders to get up while working/sitting for long periods of time. The application "Move" also randomly gives the user an exercise to complete with every reminder. On the contrary, our product allows users to not only get reminders to get up and move around after being stationary for a while, it allows them to manage their weekly amount of time that they have to work on the different courses they may be taking.

# Sprint 1

- [Trello Board (Backlogs and Requirements)](https://trello.com/b/KJKknr6O/project-task-board)
- [Burndown Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12tdoDcIdkjIooK6anzd5tF59lHYUTzUjkSDbxJay16k/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Velocity Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12s2MgZycmOZ50Mo1SNa9Wc9LwtmNB-iMbmJFyHv1GJs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Task Allocation

_Hasan Assaidi_ - Revision of product vision statement and setup of trello board

During this sprint, I completely changed our product's vision statement. In addition I setup the trello board for the group to collaborate on. I also created the source code file of the product and included a few of the libraries required to develop an android app in java. (Hasan Assaidi)


_Yoseph Hassan_ - Created user stories and validations for the product backlog

While working through this sprint I mainly worked on finishing the product backlog and coming up with user stories that would be consistent with what was proposed in the product vision. I also decribed the validation criteria for each of these user stories and their relative priority as well as the estimated difficulty. (Yoseph Hassan)


_Jean Cestin_ - Worked on sprint backlog 

For this sprint I reviewed the product backlog and completed the sprint backlog.Base on the effort the team chose, I made the subtask more spesific so it could be easier for us to get the project done. I also installed visual studio which is the sotfware we will use to build the app. (Jean Cestin)


_Christopher Delarosa_ - Worked on Burndown & Velocity charts

I managed both burndown and velocity charts over the course of this sprint. For the burndown chart, I based it off of the effort that the group may be exherting over each sprint in the project's life cycle. Similarly, the velocity chart is spaced to account for the number of tasks we would like to achieve for the sprint vs the amount we would actually end up completing. (Christopher Delarosa)


_Pedro Nemalceff_ - Worked on the Requirements

During this sprint, I worked on the requirements. I had to include both functional and non functional requirements. I also had to make sure that each one of the requirements linked with a user story. (Pedro Nemalceff)

## Task Allocation

_Hasan Assaidi_ - Design Document and Demonstration

During this sprint, I completed several of the minor subheadings of the design document. I also completed the user interface design as well as the initial demonstration of the product (a splash screen/hello world application). (Hasan Assaidi)


_Yoseph Hassan_ - User Stories, requirements, design document, and Trello board.

During this sprint, I added five more user stories as well as five more requirements to go with them. I updated the Trello board accordingly and also elaborated on some of the sections of the design document. (Yoseph Hassan)


_Jean Cestin_ - Class Diagram (code Design), Performance, and Overengineering

In this sprint (sprint 2), I was able to read some files on wikipedia to find more information about class diagram another to complete the code design for sprint 2. I also completed the performnce of the system nd the overengineering.(Jen Cestin)


_Christopher Delarosa_ - Subheadings and Diagram Creation (Design Document)

I managed a handful of the subheadings for the Design Document for this sprint, which included making the context, container, and component diagrams for the Program Organization subheading. The Interoperability, Error Processing, and Fault Tolerance subheadings were also managed by myself. (Christopher Delarosa)

## Task Allocation

_Hasan Assaidi_ - GUI User Story, Testing, and Demonstration

During this sprint, I created the general GUI for the application. I did so by creating several different activities and linking each button to its associated screen/activity. I tested the user story using a manual test. I also merged all of the different user stories that were worked on into one version of the application. In addition, I completed the demonstration of the progress made so far by the end of the sprint. (Hasan Assaidi)


_Yoseph Hassan_ - Add/Remove Course User Story

During this sprint, I added the adding and removing course name and credit hours functionality which was described in the user stories in the Trello board. I associated the adding and removing with an Arrayist data structure. I then mapped these functions to the add and remove buttons which are found on the update courses page in the application. I then proceeded to manually test the functionality of the code. I provided testing documentation in this gituhub. (Yoseph Hassan)


_Jean Cestin_ - 

_Christopher Delarosa_ - Timer User Story

 I created the stopwatch functionality during this Sprint, mainly focusing on ensuring that the counter displayed on screen would properly show how long it's been since the user began the study session. I've also ensured that the timer does start when the user presses the start button, which is found in the study session page of the program. Testing and further work on features and functionality are still in progress. (Christopher Delarosa)
